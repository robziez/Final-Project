<p id="about1">   Lisa was first introduced to the jewelry business when she was only 19 years old. She dabbled in selling jewlery to help supplement her income. Many years later, she decided to expand her business and make it her full-time work. She came to call it, Shining Tiara Jewelry, as her shining tiaras that she sells are often found on her head and have become a signature to her customers. With no one place to call a store front, Shining Tiara Jewelry is a traveling boutique. With events at craft fairs, festivals, flea markets, special events, and fundraisers - there is really no place Lisa hasn't taken her business. While the majority of events are located in Massachusetts, Shining Tiara can occasionaly be spotted in locations around New Hampshire and Maine.</p>
<p id="about2">   Shining Tiara Jewlery boasts a wide selection of handcrafted jewelry - From sterling silver chains, rings, pendants, braclets, earrings, toe rings, and anklets, to small and chunky gemstones, and fun costume jewlery for every occasion. Patrons always enjoy a unique shopping experience with Lisa, who is present at each and every event. </p>
